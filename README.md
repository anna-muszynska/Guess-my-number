### Rules 
In this game you are trying to guess the secret number, which is randomly selected from 1 to 20. Do your best and try to beat your highscore!
### About 
It is the final version of the game. I've done this project during online JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. I've been coding along with Jonas and you can see all taken steps in [JS-exercises](https://github.com/anna-muszynska/JS-exercises) repository.
